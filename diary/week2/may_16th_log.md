#May 16th Log:
I didn't feel like I did a lot but I did something. I tried to write a couple of flask tests today on certain endpoints. I have a tendency to get stuck in the weeds assuming there is a 'right' way to do something so then I end up reaching paralysis by overthinking. I was hung up on whether I needed to do a setUp and tearDown in my tests, specifically of creating a new table and populating the table. I used pgloader originally to load in all of the crime data so I thought I needed to do it a different way (assuming it would be a 'better way') by generating from the csv from python using sqlalchemy. I was told that if I used pgloader to load in the csv, do the same thing with the test data. That being said, the test data gets pre-loaded before the tests begin. The set up will not handle this part, it will just connect to the database.


I tried to do a little bit of the bounds creation. I haven't gotten to the point where I can display my top left and bottom right corners, but right now I am assuming they work. I am missing some sort of weird crucial piece as to generating that bound. I know that the only way for me to generate a bound is whenever there is a start and end address loaded into the map itself. Once I can think through that part and confirm that the top left and bottom right coords make sense, I'll definitely be on the right track.
